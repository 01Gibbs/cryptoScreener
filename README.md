## CryptoBucks: A Crypto Screener Application

This Portfolio Website Project utilises a modified starter code from codebucks27. Repository found here: https://github.com/codebucks27/CryptoBucks-A-crypto-screener-application <br />

I have taken basic principles and extrapolated the concepts and applied them to my own needs and designs for a portfolio website project following and expanding upon the principles outlined in CodeBucks Tutorial <br />
